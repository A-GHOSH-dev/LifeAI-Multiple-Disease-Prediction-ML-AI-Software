# Crow_Search_Algorithm
Optimization of hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms using Crow Search Algorithm for diabetes prediction.
## General Introduction:
Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) is a recently developed algorithm that simulates the behavior of crows in the storage and recovery of food, it is an optimization approach, it allows to optimize hyperparameters, population-based with only two configurable parameters, flight length, and awareness probability, making it particularly attractive for applications in various technical fields. Among these limitations and forces: No literature has studied these setting parameters, which can be hybridized with many other algorithms.
