# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Disease:

## Dataset Links

The dataset were used from kaggle.

- [Kidney Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease)

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Kidney-Disease       | Machine Learning Model   | 98.33%   |

## I Hope this Will be Useful to practise the Machine Learning.
