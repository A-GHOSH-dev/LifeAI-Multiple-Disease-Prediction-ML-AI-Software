## Abstract

LifeAI- Multiple Disease Detection Software will be a platform for the users to fill their data and get to know
the predictions of them being positive or negative to certain chronic diseases. As we know, due to the large
population, getting healthcare access is also becoming difficult in various places. There is an increased pressure
on the healthcare infrastructure especially due to the pandemic. Also, most people die of these chronic diseases
due to late checking. This platform will help users in all these aspects. We use Machine Learning and Deep
Learning Algorithms and BioInspired Algorithms along with Django to build this software.

- Alzheimer’s Dementia Prediction- 2D CNN for Dementia Architecture
- Breast Cancer Prediction- Hyperparameter Tuning and Genetic Algorithm
- Heart Disease Prediction- Ensemble Learning with Ant Colony Optimization
- Diabetes Prediction- Supervised Learning with Crow Search Optimization
- Parkinson’s Disease Prediction- Voice data based Support Vector Machine Algorithm
- Lung Cancer prediction using XGBoost
